# Public Sector Average Emissions Dashboard aka Industry CO2 Insigths

A public dashboard for emissions.

## Installation

> ðŸš§ **Warning**
>
> It is currently not possible for developers not associated with Normative to
> start this project as it requires access to protected resources.

```bash
# Log in to NPM so you can access private packages.
$ yarn npm login
# Install all the dependencies.
$ yarn
```

## Running the app

```bash
# Run the local dev server connected to local services
$ yarn run dev

# Build deployment bundle
$ yarn run build

# Run ESLint
$ yarn run lint

# Run Prettier and format
$ yarn run format
```

## Running against Normative dev environment

You will need to create a file `.env.dev-staging` (this is gitignored and should not be committed to the repository). In this file, set variables:

```
PUBLIC_VAR_SECTOR_AVERAGE_SERVICE_PROTO_DOMAIN=... https://... domain for the dev sector-average-service.
CLIENT_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=xyz
```

Then you can launch a local server connected to the staging services:

```bash
$ yarn run dev-staging
```

## Running in container

This project is part of public profile infrastructure and can start along with other services in a docker environment. To find out more how docker image is created/started, look at this [README](https://github.com/normative-io/sme-public-profile-infrastructure-public/blob/main/README.md) file

## Dev setup

**NVM, Node/NPM version:** \
The project is currently set up for Node 14. There is a `.nvmrc` file in
the repository root, so you can run `nvm use` to switch to the matching version.
It's also possible to integrate nvm with your shell further (for bash, zsh,
fish) to run `nvm use` automatically when changing directories. See
[documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration).

**VSCode TypeScript version:** \
To use the package.json defined version of TypeScript, open a .ts or .tsx file,
then bring up the command palette (`ctrl+shift+p`), run "Select TypeScript
Version...", and pick "Use Workspace Version".

**EditorConfig:** \
The repo includes a [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to specify basic
editor settings for indentation, character-set, etc. Please install the VS Code
EditorConfig extension, or the plugin for your preferred editor/IDE so that the
project settings will be used.
